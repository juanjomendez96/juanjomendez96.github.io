      <h2>Clinical-grade data pipelines with Databricks momentum.</h2>
      <p>
        Six years designing orchestrated Python data stacks that stay observable under pressure. I translate clinical
        trial signals into trusted dashboards while scaling Databricks workspaces that safely run multiple studies in
        parallel.
